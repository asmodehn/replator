Because strange beasts also need a home.


## Goal
1) Being a proving ground for any simple programming language (DSL, esoteric, etc.)
2) Providing tools to experiment and improve denotational (categorical) & operational (VM-interpreted) semantics of a language
3) Helping with transition to::
 
 - idris 
 - pypy
 
and make it as simple and faithful as possible.
